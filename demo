I recommend 2-4 players, but you can do as many as you want! Before each match, press Reset, then select your team. You will be taken to a beautiful huge wildlife map with two structures in the middle and replenishment of chests around the map with random replenishments.The map is ideal for large numbers of players and small numbers of players, it works with both 2 and 30 players and is versatile enough to accommodate all kinds of different play styles!The Wizarding Tower is another shop that searches for stars found in comets. These comets fall from the sky at specific locations and contain empty stars. You can buy magic items there, such as cows that grow leather, health boosters, elytra, ender pearls, a gust of wind that launches you into the air, and more!</p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 182px;\" src=\"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7190/images/arborcraft-games-unique-and-groundbreaking-minigames_8.png\" /></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p></p>\n<figure class=\"image\" style=\"text-align: justify;\"><img class=\"lazyLoad isLoaded\" style=\"width: 320px; height: 182px;\" src=\"https://my.mcpedl.com/storage/worlds/7190/images/arborcraft-games-unique-and-groundbreaking-minigames_8.png\" /></figure>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>version: 1.16.x."
